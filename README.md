drawDB Collaborative is an unofficial fork of
[drawDB](https://github.com/drawdb-io/drawdb). It adds centralized SQLite
storage and real-time WebSocket collaboration while retaining drawDB's
browser-based ERD editing and SQL import/export features.

This fork is independently maintained and is not affiliated with or endorsed
by the original drawDB maintainers.

Key additions include:

- Centralized diagram storage backed by SQLite
- Real-time table movement and editing between participants
- Participant presence and viewport-aware collaborative cursors
- Optimistic version checks that prevent stale clients from overwriting changes
- A single-container setup for the frontend, API, WebSocket server, and storage

## Getting Started

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yms2772/drawdb-collaborative.git
cd drawdb-collaborative
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts both the Vite frontend on port `5173` and the API/WebSocket server
on port `3000`. Use `npm run dev:client` or `npm run dev:server` when only one
side is needed.

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yms2772/drawdb-collaborative.git
cd drawdb-collaborative
npm install
npm run build
```

### Docker Build

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The single application container serves the
frontend, diagram API, WebSocket collaboration endpoint, and SQLite storage.
The Compose configuration persists the database in the `drawdb-data` volume.

### Collaborative self-hosting

Diagrams are stored centrally in SQLite; IndexedDB is not used for diagram
storage. `DATABASE_PATH` controls the database location and defaults to
`./data/drawdb.sqlite` outside the container. Diagram URLs use
`/diagrams/:diagramId`, and everyone opening the same URL joins the same live
session automatically.

The application exposes:

- `GET|POST /api/diagrams`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/diagrams/:diagramId`
- `/ws/diagrams/:diagramId` (WebSocket)

Snapshot saves are debounced and guarded by an optimistic version. Stale
clients receive the current snapshot instead of silently overwriting it.
Reconnects send the last known version and converge on the server snapshot.

When running behind a reverse proxy, forward `X-Forwarded-For` and
`X-Forwarded-Proto`, and allow WebSocket `Upgrade`/`Connection` headers on the
`/ws` path. The browser derives `ws://` or `wss://` from the current origin, so
no public hostname or `localhost` value is required in production.
